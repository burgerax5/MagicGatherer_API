# MagicGatherer
This project is a website for tracking your Magic: The Gathering cards, using the prices from the CardKingdom website. The goal was to have a dedicated server for scraping the website periodically and updating the database which will be used by my API. The clients will interact with the frontend server to send requests over to the API.

One thing I am proud of is not giving up on the project. I tried working with a bunch of new technologies and struggled my way through. I'm not satisfied with the current state of the project as it is very buggy but I intend on improving it in the future.

## Basic Requirements:
I have checked all the basic requirements except for using a styling library. I didn't read the requirements properly, and in hindsight, BIG MISTAKE.

## Advanced Requirements:
I tried to containerize and deploy my applications on Azure but came across issues.
- Unit testing for my web scraper & web API
- Redux for state management
- Switching between light/dark mode
